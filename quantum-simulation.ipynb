    "and simulating this requires the ability to perform the operation above.  In most cases, this reduces to matrix exponentiation, but proves to be very difficult on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the operator as the system size increases.  A good attempt at a first order solution is $\\ket{\\psi(t+\\Delta t)}\\approx (I-iH\\Delta t)\\ket{\\psi(t)}$, but this is generally not satisfactory.  However, if we can exponentiate the Hamiltonian, we only need a sufficiently small time step to simulate our system\n",

For the physicists out there, both the Ising and Hubbard models (as we'll see later on) can be written in this way.  The advantage of writing the Hamiltonian in this way is that although the total time evolution operator $e^{iHt}$ may be difficult to compute, it is much easier to use $e^{iH_kt}$ as it acts on a much smaller subsytem and is straightforward to approximate using quantum circuits."

The goal is to get the simulator from point A to point B along a particular route. But the simulator can only be driven in certain directions--the operations that can be applied experimentally are limited--so it is usually not possible to go from point A to point B directly. But by moving the simulator first a little bit in one direction, then a little bit in another, then a little bit in another, and so on, it is possible to move from A to B. A car can only be driven forward and backward--it cannot be driven sideways. But it is still possible to parallel park. The following construction demonstrates a quantum analog of a familiar classical fact: By going forward and backing up a sufficiently small distance a large enough number of times, it is possible to parallel park in a space only $\\epsilon$ longer than the length of the care </blockquote>"

    "## 3. The Fermi-Hubard Model <a id='hubbard-models'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the tools available to simulate a quantum system using a quantum computer, let's choose a system to try this out on.  The Hubbard model of many electron systems was initially introduced to provide a model to consider the behavior of correlated electrons in solids, and research on it has since grown dramatically and become a mainstay within theoretical condensed matter physics.  The model itself is an extension of the tight-binding model--a simple toy model wherein electrons are allowed to \"hop\" between neighboring lattice sites, but do not interact with each other--and introduced an interaction term $U$ for each pair of electrons occupying the same lattice site as a means to represent Coulomb repulsion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Though the Hubbard model may appear simple, this simplicity is deceptive as it turns out to be a mathematically difficult problem to solve due to its many-body nature.  Thus far an exact solution has only been found for the one-dimensional case.  Numerical simulations of the model in higher dimensions are quite common, but a true analytic solution has yet to be found.  As such, since quantum computing promises to solve many different numerically difficult problems, its incorporation into quantum computing may provide insights into these interesting systems.  Regardless, studying this model remains a staple within the condensed matter community primarily because it has emerged as a candidate model to explain high-temperature superconductivity and is a first step in understanding highly correlated physics.  \n",

    "To construct the Hamiltonian of our Hubbard system, we envision a chain or lattice of sites which have space to hold up to two electrons which can either be spin up $\\uparrow$ or down $\\downarrow$, therefore each site can be in one of four states: $\\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{0}, \\ket{\\uparrow}, \\ket{\\downarrow}, \\ket{\\uparrow \\downarrow}$.  To start, let's thinking about what the kinetic energy should look like.  The simplest way to consider this is by imagining an electron \"hopping\" from one site to the next and is written as:\n",

The operators $\\hat{c}$ and $\\hat{c}^\\dagger$ are known as the \"creation\" and \"annihilation\" operators and provide a useful tool for us which first appear in most textbooks in the quantum harmonic oscillator system (the details of which can be left aside for now).

In this system, we describe the state basis as a direct product for each of the site occupations $\\ket{\\psi}=\\ket{n_1,...,n_N}$.  The ladder operators become creation and annihilation operators at a site $i$ with spin $\\sigma$ ($\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma}$ and $\\hat{c}_{i,\\sigma}$ respectively).

Out of all the $2^4=16$ possible states, we can separate these into three sets of states depending on the kinetic energy (or how many electrons are allowed to hop between sites).  The first set contains the completely empty lattice, the completely filled lattice, and the states with two electrons with the same spin since each of these have zero kinetic energy since hopping is not allowed or there are no electrons present to hop.  The second set are those states which allow one electron to hop between sites, either the singly or triply occupied system.  The third set are the two states which allow two electrons to hop between the sites.\n"

    "## 4. Jordan-Wigner Transformation and Encoding <a id='jw-transform'></a>\n",
    "To utilize quantum computing when simulating Hubbard-like systems, one needs to first transform the Hubbard Hamiltonian into a set of operations accessible to quantum computers.  Namely, we use the Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the creation and annihilation operators of the Hubbard Hamiltonian to a set of Pauli matrices.  Traditionally, the Hubbard Hamiltonian in second quantization utilize creation and annihilation operators $\\hat{c}_{j,\\sigma}$ and $\\hat{c}_{j,\\sigma}^\\dagger$ which changes the occupation of a given spin orbital, as described above.  In a quantum computing environment, we map each fermionic mode (a given site with a given spin) to a single qubit.  Since we are now indexing by mode, we then drop the spin index and sum over the fermionic modes with the action of each operator being $\\hat{c}_{j}^\\dagger\\ket{0}_{j} = \\ket{1}_{j}$,  $\\hat{c}_{j}\\ket{1}_{j} = \\ket{0}_{j}$, $\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{j}\\ket{1}_{j}=0$, and $\\hat{c}_{j}\\ket{0}_{j}=0$ for each fermionic mode $j$.

We know that $\\hat{c}_{j}$ and $\\hat{c}_{j}^\\dagger$, as defined in the previous section, anti-commute but this combination of Pauli matrices do not.  This can be remedied by noting that the Pauli matrices naturally anti-commute by $XZ = -ZX$ and $YZ = -ZY$.
